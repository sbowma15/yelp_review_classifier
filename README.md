Classifying Yelp Reviews

Overview
This notebook focuses on enhancing the simple perceptron Yelp review classifier developed earlier. The main objective is to experiment with multi-layer perceptrons and modify various elements of the model to improve accuracy on the test data. The key elements to experiment with include adding linear layers, changing activation functions, and optional modifications to hyperparameters, optimizer, and scheduler.

Key Elements to Experiment With
Adding Layers: Experiment with adding one or more linear layers to the model.
Activation Functions: Explore different activation functions between layers.
Optional Modifications: Optionally modify hyperparameters, optimizer, scheduler, etc.
